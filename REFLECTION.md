What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?

I learned how functions like .map(),.filter(), and .reduce() can make code shorter and easier to read. Each one also
loops automatically so 'for' loops aren't needed.

What was the most confusing part?

It was a little confusing how .reduce() worked but after looking at it closely I realized it loops and adds up everything.
